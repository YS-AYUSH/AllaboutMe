    <h1>SPIRITUALITY</h1>
    <h3>Spirituality , it  is the most important aspect of human life, to know that we are not this body and to know that merely bodily sense gratification 
        is not going to give us evelasting happiness. The Goal of Human life is not to eat , sleep , mate and defend , which even animals do , it is to 
        inquire about our true self and know our relation ship with God.
